# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Develop a webpage to provide an analysis on UFO sightings throughout the United States. Added filters to allow for multiple criteria searches and find certain data points.

## Results

In the side bar, you can enter as much or as little search criteria as you'd like to find direct matches. The key is to enter your search criteria exactly following the formatting as it is found printed in the table.

Entering the search criteria and hitting "enter" will return your results.

You can clear the search criteria and hit "enter" to return to an unfiltered table.

You can search for multiple filters at one time.

If you enter search criteria and no results return, it means there is no data that matches your search criteria.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that the search bars only recognize information that directly matches the data in the table, and the data in the table varies widely in formatting. For example, you would have to search "benton" exactly as printed in the table to get the desired results--typing "Benton" will return no results.

The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development

For further development, we could do some data cleaning to help make the data a little more uniform. On the other side, we could make the user input a little more flexible in the results that it finds in the data such that it doesn't look for a 100% direct match with the user input.

Additionally, I would like a notification if there is no found data matching the search criteria.
