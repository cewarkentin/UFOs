## Overview of Project

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that the search bars only recognize information that directly matches the data in the table, and the data in the table varies widely in formatting. For example, you would have to search "benton" exactly as printed in the table to get the desired results--typing "Benton" will return no results.

The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development

For further development, we could do some data cleaning to help make the data a little more uniform. On the other side, we could make the user input a little more flexible in the results that it finds in the data such that it doesn't look for a 100% direct match with the user input.

Additionally, I would like a notification if there is no found data matching the search criteria.
